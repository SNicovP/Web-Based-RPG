This is a Role Playing game where you have to defeat a Dragon to rescue a town. The game as 3 values it tracks and displays for the player (XP) (Health) (Gold). The player gets to Farm (XP) and (Gold) at the Cave location so that they can improve their gear to eventually fight and defeat the Dragon. The game has a hidden easter egg built in aswell that lets you farm (Gold) at a risk. You can easily modify the JS and HTML code to suit your own scenario. I created a Afrikaans version with is own setting as an example of how you can modify it.

Folders:

RPG: This folder contains everything for the English version of the game 
RPG - Afr: This folder contains everything for the Afrikaans(my native language) version of the game

Feel free to modify and improve on the code and send it to me so I can upload it for everyone to experience and enjoy!
